Technical Notes
===============
These are my current thoughts, and I allow myself to revise
it overtime as I move forward on this carreer and gain more 
experience.


Common local dev env setup
===========================
I uses git as code repository with dockerfile to containerized my  application
and docker-compoae.yaml to glue multiple container. Also needed to add  Makefile to 
automate common commands like docker build or docker run, I put all application's
source code on src/ directory and also put my ci/cd pipeline code on project
root folder.

like this

docker-compose.yaml
makefile
dockerfile
Jenkinsfile
/src
/manifest -> helm pkg



* Ã­ think shared hosting is good for cms like apps only eg. wordpress
* I tried aws  but too afraid for charges
* I tried deploying django apps in heroku
* vim is cool, but not for web development.
* mailtrap is useful for testing mail feature
* css is pain
* If going to write a library try interface implement
* oop -> solid


git branch

master
sprint

story



* CI/CD pipeline
git -> build -> push -> container registry -> ssh -> deploy
        |
        -> dynamic and static test
