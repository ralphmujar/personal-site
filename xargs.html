<p class="content">
All of a sudden I wanted to know the size of some binary file
I know there is this unix command called  
<code>du</code> it will give me the size of the file
but the problem is I dont know where the file is! luckily I know one command called 
<code>which</code> that will 
give me the exact location of the file on the fs so I think 
finding the file is not really a problem. but I got another prob, 
how can I combine these commands? It turns out there is a unix 
command call <code>xarg</code> it standard inputs can be pass as parameter 
to other commands 
<br><br>
<code>> which bash | xargs du -h</code>
<br>
<br>
Output:
<br>
<br>
<code> 720k	/bin/bash </code>
